# Litfeed
2nd attempt at feed parsing! Now with more comments!

A website powered by react that allows you to keep track of manga using RSS feeds.

Feeds that you are tracking will be organized in a 4x(n/4) grid, with N being the number of feeds you're following. 
Currently, you're able to submit a single feed in the startpage. The app then pulls information from the feed and creates/renders a new feedcard
so that you can see the chapters that are curently out.
